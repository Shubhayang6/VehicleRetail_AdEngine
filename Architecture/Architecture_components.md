## Vehicle Components

- **Telematics ECU**: The Electronic Control Unit responsible for collecting and transmitting vehicle telemetry data (speed, engine status, diagnostics, etc.) to the cloud. It acts as the central hub for vehicle data aggregation.
- **Sensors**: Hardware devices embedded in the vehicle to monitor parameters such as speed, location, engine temperature, braking, and more. These provide raw data for analysis.
- **Infotainment System**: The in-vehicle display and user interface. It shows alerts, maintenance notifications, advertisements, retail recommendations, and enables direct interaction with e-commerce and payment services.
- **Onboard AI Module**: Local AI/ML models for real-time driver behavior analysis and anomaly detection, enabling quick feedback and edge intelligence.

## Connectivity Layer

- **IoT Gateway**: Manages secure data transmission from the vehicle to the cloud, typically via cellular or Wi-Fi. Also supports OTA (Over-The-Air) updates for firmware and AI models.

## Cloud Services (AWS)

- **AWS IoT Core**: Handles secure connectivity and device management for vehicles, enabling scalable ingestion of telemetry data.
- **Data Lake (S3)**: Centralized storage for raw and processed vehicle data, supporting analytics and historical analysis.
- **Kinesis/Data Streams**: Real-time data streaming and processing, allowing for immediate event detection and response.
- **Lambda Functions**: Serverless compute for event-driven processing, such as filtering, transforming, or routing incoming data.
- **SageMaker (ML Models)**: Managed machine learning service for training and deploying models that predict maintenance needs and analyze driver behavior.
- **Agentic AI Service**: Orchestrates user interactions, predictive maintenance, and service scheduling. Integrates with external APIs and manages conversational AI tasks.
- **Personalization/Ad Engine**: Delivers context-aware advertisements and product recommendations based on driving style, location, and vehicle status.
- **OEM Retail Recommendation Engine**: Provides personalized product suggestions (e.g., engine oil, accessories) from the OEM, tailored to the user's driving context and vehicle needs.
- **E-commerce API & OEM Portal**: Enables direct product ordering from the vehicle, integrating with the OEM's retail platform and supporting order placement and management.
- **Payment Services (QR/Online)**: Facilitates secure payment processing, including QR code and online payment options, directly from the infotainment system.
- **Email Service**: Sends order confirmations and updates to the user's email account, ensuring seamless post-purchase communication.
- **Maps & Calendar Integration**: Provides location-based services and calendar access for scheduling maintenance and service appointments.

## User Components

- **Mobile App/Web Portal**: Allows users to view vehicle health, schedule service, and manage preferences outside the vehicle.
- **Calendar**: Used for booking service appointments and integrating with scheduling APIs.
- **Email Account**: Receives order confirmations and updates from the e-commerce system.

## OEM Service Center

- **Service Scheduling API**: Interface for booking and managing service appointments at authorized OEM centers.

## Rationale for Each Component

- **Edge Intelligence**: Onboard AI and sensors enable real-time feedback and reduce latency for critical alerts.
- **Secure Connectivity**: IoT Gateway and AWS IoT Core ensure data privacy and integrity during transmission.
- **Scalable Data Management**: Data Lake and Kinesis support large-scale analytics and real-time event processing.
- **Advanced Analytics**: SageMaker and Lambda enable predictive maintenance and personalized recommendations.
- **Agentic AI**: Automates user interactions, maintenance scheduling, and integrates with external services for a seamless experience.
- **Personalization & Retail Integration**: Ad Engine and Retail Recommendation Engine provide targeted offers, while e-commerce and payment services enable direct transactions from the vehicle.
- **User Experience**: Infotainment System, Email, and Calendar integration ensure users are informed and empowered to act on recommendations and offers.
- **OEM Integration**: Service Scheduling API and OEM Portal connect users with authorized service centers and retail offerings.
